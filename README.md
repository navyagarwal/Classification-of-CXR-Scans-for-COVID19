# Classifying CXR Scans for COVID-19

This repository contains the codes and research paper for my work on "Classifying Chest Radiography Scans for COVID-19".

The research paper is published in IEEE Xplore as part of the conference proceedings of International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Speech Technology (AIST) 2022, the annual conference hosted by Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women.

In this study, the results of 3 different neural network architectures have been compared, that were tasked to classify a CXR scan into a normal, COVID-19 infected or Viral Pneumonia infected lung scan.

The main focus of the work is to determine the impact of Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning on the result outputs in specific use-cases of classification CNN models like that of medical image classification.
